Release notes for Ico
Ico 0.94
    Upgrade Raphael to version 1.2.8, remove path-methods as recommended from version 1.0
    Allow to clear grpah canvas, typically to redraw in the same div.
    Display value label units, optional units_position allows to set units before values
    Define components layers for calculations and drawing
    Allow graph area background to display bad, satisfactory and good attributes as a gradient
    Implement Stephen Few Bullet Graphs
    Reorganize code, componentize grpah elements, remove redundant code
    Allow all (path, labels, grid, background, meanline, ...)-attributes configuration
    Display mouse pointer as a cross when in graph area
    Display data values and mean value on mouse over in status area
    Change data and meanline stroke attribute on mouse over
    Provide svg_path class method to round pixel values and add separators only when needed 
    Test suite
        Perform all tests on IE 8.0, Firefox 3.5, Opera 10.0, Chrome, Safari
    API Changes
    Fix and optimize value labels range / start and stop calculations
        Always display zero value when in value range
        Find best (step, number of steps) pairs to minimize display range and emphasize data values
        Design significant digits calculation class method with options rounding anomymous function
            and optional string output to prevent float precision conversion errors
        Build value labels as strings instead of float
        Fix value step to one significant digit
        Fix value labels to two significant digits
        Fix value labels precision to maximum precision of all value labels
        Determine number of maximum steps based on actual graph width and labels size
        Provide scale attribute to scale values to actual graph height
    Fix bars base value to start at zero when in range and display negative values in reverse direction
    Allow labels at an angle
    Design function to properly calculate text display size in pixels
    Fix bottom and left offset calculations using actual text size
    Remove sort used to determine longuest labels, iterate through array instead.
    Fix sort comparison function to determine longuest labels.
    Numerous other bug fixes
    
Wish list:
 - Terminate options componentization
 - Componentize series to allow bars and lines in the same graph
 - Zoom-in spark lines, spark bars, and bullet graphs on-mouse-over.
 - Display full graph of spark lines and spark bars on mouse-click
 - Multiple series columns with 1/3 overlap
 - Title
 - Legend
 - Display values in tooltips instead of status bar, tooltips implemented w/ an external DOM library to
   enable out-of-the-canvas tooltips 
 - Allow user events on graph elements
 - Draw labels on top (or right if orientation) if all values are negative
 - Remove prototype dependency, should also work w/ jQuery, Mootools
   sh/could probably become js library agnostic as most of the browser specific code is in Raphael itself
 - API: Provide series-specific-attributes as keys from serie hash, series becomes an array of hash where
   each represents a serie if a hash is provided instead of an array then assume there is only one
   serie.
