h2. Introduction

Ico is a JavaScript graph library that uses "Raphael":http://raphaeljs.com/ to draw and Prototype.
This means it can draw charts in multiple browsers, using VML in IE, and SVG in all other browsers.
Also because this does not rely on Flash, it works well (and is tested) on iPhone.

The original version was written by Alex Young. The current version features a new API, mainly due
to componentization of all graph features, many bug fixes, new features, most importantly implements
bullet graphs, inclined labels, gradient backgrounds, proper negative bar grpahs rendering.

To see a demo of the possibilities of the current version, check
<a href="http://ser2.dialink.com:8080/">the current test suite</a> which is a rendering of index.html.

h3. Targeted graph types

* Sparklines, Sparbars, and Bullet Graphs
* Line graphs
* Bar graphs, Horizontal, Vertical

h3. Design considerations and goals

* Clarity: Use of white-space to help lend clarity to graphs, nominal scale vs. ordinal scale
* Simplicity: Minimal use of decorations and lines, reliance on the Gestalt principle of closure
* Conciseness: Avoidance of graph types that don't efficiently present data (pie charts, radar maps)

These goals are based on recommendations in Stephen Few's books:

* Show Me the Numbers: Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten
* Information Dashboard Design

Which was generally in turn based on Edward Tufte's work.

h3. Tested web browsers, known issues

* Firefox: best compromize of quality and speed, some rendering problems of inclined fonts
* IE: best inclined fonts rendering, slowest by far
* Safari: fastest, bugs: while zooming
* Google Chrome: good quality, bugs: while zooming
* iPhone (Safari): pretty amazing, try it
* Opera: good fonts rendering, bugs: zoom, mouse-over while scrolling

h3. ToDo / Wish list

* Add Legend component
* Add Title component
* Display values in tooltips instead of status bar, tooltips implemented w/ an external DOM library
to enable out-of-the-canvas tooltips
* Documentation
* Terminate options componentization
* Componentize series to allow bars and lines in the same graph
* Zoom-in spark lines, spark bars, and bullet graphs on-mouse-over.
* Display full graph of spark lines and spark bars on mouse-click, possibly in a tooltip
* Bar graphs: multiple series columns with 1/3 overlap
* Allow user events on graph elements
* Draw labels on top (or right if orientation) if all values are negative
* Remove prototype dependency, should also work w/ jQuery, Mootools sh/could probably become js library
agnostic as most of the browser specific code is in Raphael itself
  
h3. API changes that might come

Provide series-specific-attributes as keys from serie hash, series becomes an array of hash where
each represents a serie if a hash is provided instead of an array then assume there is only one
serie.

h2. Examples

See index.html for current API usage.

h2. Requirements

* "Raphael":http://raphaeljs.com
* "Prototype":http://prototypejs.org
